ðŸŸ© How to Use It on Another System
ðŸ”§ Step-by-step:
Install Anaconda (or Miniconda) on the new system

Open terminal (or Anaconda Prompt)

Create and activate a new environment:


conda create -n deca_env python=3.8 -y
conda activate deca_env
Download or copy requirements.txt to that system

Install everything (with GPU support):


pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
âœ… This ensures you get the correct +cu121 builds for CUDA 12.1, compatible with your driver (even if CUDA Toolkit isn't installed).

ðŸ§  Notes
If you donâ€™t have GPU on the target system, replace:

txt
Copy
Edit
torch==2.2.2+cu121
torchvision==0.17.2+cu121
with:

txt
Copy
Edit
torch==2.2.2
torchvision==0.17.2
If you're compiling the rasterizer (with rasterizer_type: standard), youâ€™ll also need to:

Install CUDA Toolkit 12.1

Set CUDA_HOME in system variables
